Profile Picture: Use a clear and attractive profile photo.

Username: Choose a simple and memorable username.

Bio: Write a short bio that explains who you are. Add keywords related to your niche.

7. Collaborate with Others

Collaborating with other TikTok creators can help you reach new audiences. Partner with creators in your niche. Make duets, stitches, or co-create content. This will introduce your profile to their followers.
